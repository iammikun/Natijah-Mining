              The world of technology advances at a fast pace, and we are moving
              into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, an era in which
              digitization and technology will affect us in all spheres of life
              and become embedded within societies.

              technology and the technology of artificial intelligence. It is

              environment and our societies will look like in a few decades from
              now.
